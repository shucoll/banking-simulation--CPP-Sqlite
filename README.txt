Welcome to the OOP innovative project by Shuvam Shiwakoti

This text file gives a brief introduction on how to navigate around the folder and files in the project and how to run the program.

First, open this entire folder containing all the files for the project in the text editor or IDE. 

Firstly, run the "setup.cpp" file, which will create and set up the database needed for the program.
This step creates the .db file where the data is stored.
Note- DO NOT RUN THE LAUNCHER FILE BEFORE THE SETUP FILE OR IT MIGHT GIVE AN ERROR 

Once the setup is done and the database is created, this process need not be repeated.
Once this is done, the program can be launched any number of times using "launcher.cpp".

To launch the program, simply run the CPP file named "launcher.cpp".

This will launch the program and display the first menu (--- Main Menu ---).
The menus in the program are self-explanatory and are easy to understand and work with.

It may be noted that both the program files be run on the integrated terminal provided in the text editor or IDE. This is necessary for creating and launching the database. 

The System must have the SQLite command-line tools to run this program. This usually comes inbuilt with MacOS, but it might have to be installed for Windows or Linux operating systems.
If the SQLite command-line tools are not present, the following link can be used as a guide to download and install SQLite in the system..
